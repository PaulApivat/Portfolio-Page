# Set up your preprocessor
1. Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running lessc -v in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, reach out to your project manager for help.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the cd command
3. Once in your project's root folder, run the following command less-watch-compiler less css index.less
4. Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the background-color on the html selector to red
5. Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task
